# KAG (Knowledge Augmented Generation) System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This project implements a Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG) system using Qwen2-30B model with vLLM for efficient inference. KAG loads documents directly into the model's KV cache for faster responses and more efficient context utilization compared to traditional RAG. The system will connect to an open-source chatbot frontend to provide a user-friendly interface with per-user conversation contexts.

## Architecture

### 1. Components
- **Document Processor**: Prepares documents for loading into KV cache
- **KV Cache Manager**: Handles loading and maintaining document information in KV cache
- **Query Handler**: Processes user queries while leveraging the document-loaded KV cache
- **User Session Manager**: Maintains separate conversation contexts for each user
- **API Server**: Provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints for frontend integration
- **Frontend Integration**: Connects with an open-source chatbot UI (OpenWebUI or MistralAI ChatUI)

### 2. Data Flow
1. User authenticates via the frontend UI
2. Documents relevant to the user are processed and loaded into a user-specific KV cache
3. User queries are processed against the model with their pre-loaded document context
4. Responses are generated leveraging the existing KV cache
5. User context is maintained between sessions for efficiency

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (Day 1)
- Set up Conda environment with CUDA 12.8 support
- Install vLLM and dependencies
- Configure model serving with vLLM

### Phase 2: Document Processing (Day 2)
- Implement document loading and preprocessing
- Create text chunking mechanisms
- Develop document tokenization pipeline
- Add user-specific document association

### Phase 3: KV Cache Integration (Day 3-4)
- Implement KV cache management with vLLM
- Create efficient document loading into KV cache
- Develop user session management for persistence
- Implement KV cache isolation per user conversation

### Phase 4: Query Processing (Day 5)
- Build query handling with document context
- Implement response generation
- Create user-specific conversation management
- Add context history tracking per user

### Phase 5: API Development (Day 6-7)
- Create OpenAI-compatible API for the KAG system
- Implement endpoints for document loading and querying
- Add conversation management endpoints with user authentication
- Ensure compatibility with chosen frontend

### Phase 6: Frontend Integration (Day 8-9)
- Install and configure selected frontend (OpenWebUI or MistralAI ChatUI)
- Connect frontend to KAG API server
- Configure user authentication and session handling
- Test user experience and conversation flow

### Phase 7: Testing and Optimization (Day 10-12)
- Evaluate response quality
- Measure performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- Optimize KV cache usage
- Implement memory management
- Test multi-user scenarios

## Technical Specifications

### Server Configuration
- vLLM running Qwen2-30B model on 2x H100 GPUs
- OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
- CUDA 12.8 for GPU acceleration

### Data Management
- Document format: Text or JSON
- Per-user session persistence
- Token tracking for context window management
- User authentication and data isolation

### Frontend Options
1. **OpenWebUI**
   - Open-source ChatGPT-like interface
   - Supports multiple models and conversation history
   - Active community and development
   - Easy integration with OpenAI-compatible APIs

2. **MistralAI ChatUI**
   - Clean and modern UI
   - Built specifically for LLM interaction
   - Supports conversation history and model switching
   - OpenAI API compatible

### Performance Goals
- Sub-second query response time
- Support for loading 10+ MB of document data per user
- Maintain user-specific conversation context with loaded documents
- Handle multiple concurrent users efficiently

## Next Steps
1. Setup development environment
2. Decide on frontend (OpenWebUI recommended for feature completeness)
3. Implement basic document loading with user association
4. Create KV cache integration with user isolation
5. Build query processing system
6. Install and configure frontend
7. Connect frontend to backend API
8. Test complete system with multiple users
